Secret agents use encryption all the time. You know that everything can be encrypted as different characters. 
What about encryption that uses only one character and space? This method has a name â€” the Chuck Norris cipher. 
In this project, you will create a program that can encrypt any text into a sequence of zeros and spaces and decrypt this sequence into text.
